There is a draft research paper (well, read more like a blog post) that mentioned on the two extremes of people who can't program and who can program. Today, one would like to take a look at the paper, give some of one's opinion, and give some opinion of how to let people be aware of what they're thinking, and hopefully they might be able to start programming. 

Here are the links to that [particular paper](https://web.archive.org/web/20070318023700/http://www.cs.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf), and here is the link to the [blog post](https://blog.codinghorror.com/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats/) where one first read about it. 

And lastly, one of the author **retracted the paper in 2014**, here is [the retraction](http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/staffpages/r_bornat/papers/camel_hump_retraction.pdf).

One would like to mention several things in the research paper before we start to have an overview. 

First, the author Richard **do not believe** in aptitude test for programming, nor do he believe in programming sheep and non-programming goats. In one's opinion, this might have been true. In fact, if one isn't mistaken, one would be partly the "non-programming goats" before and nowadays one programs quite a lot (no reasoning though, it's been a long time since one started programming and one can't really recall whether this statement is True or False anymore). And one believes so. 

<p class="callout success">
  Programming is a mental state problem, and if you could change your mental state, you can program. Non-programming goats not need stay goats all the way.

## The argument
Note that these are things that one extracted based on one's focus. Particularly, when one was reading, those that doesn't catch my mind goes filtered out almost immediately, and the first thing that get caught was (rephrased):

**Novice learners' tries to use <u>Natural Language</u> and expect the computer to understand their intention.**

That is, aside from machine learning, normal computer programs are rules that you tell the computer what to do. It's **meaningless**, but novice tries to derive meaning from what is conveyed. Not only that, *they try to convey their own mental representation to the computer, and hope it will understand, as if the computer has some neural networks like human (or animals) does*. 

If you're experienced programmer, you know that computer takes in meaningless commands, execute them without meaning, and output without meaning. **It's us human whom derive meaning from a program's output, not the computer give meaning to the output or the process.**

Let's take a look at an example. Consider the following code (not written in any language, particularly it's Python but one expanded `elif` to `else if` as the latter is easier to understand by non-programmers).
