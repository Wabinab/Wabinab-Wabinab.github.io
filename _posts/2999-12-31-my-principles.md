# My Principles

## Life Principles
1. Never reject a non-damaging friendship from my side, only from the other person's side. One should not let one's self-talk oneself out of a relationship; rather, only when the other person configures to quit, shall we talk it over. Narcissistic and blood-sucking relationship excluded.
