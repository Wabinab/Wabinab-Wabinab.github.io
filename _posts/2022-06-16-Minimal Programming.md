# Idea: Minimal Programming

We know that software requires security update, because we never know how it'll be hacked. There are thoughts on, however, minimal programming, where it doesn't require security update to continue its usage. 

Basically, we reduce complicated programming infrastructure to easy-to-understand infrastructure, such that no one can take advantage of the complicated infrastructure in the future. This effectively reduce potential loopholes, potential surface area 
for hackers to exploit.
