# Thinking, Fast and Slow: Some Conflicts?

The title was the book by Daniel Kahneman. One just wants to talk a bit about oneself, probably something that goes unnoticed. Say, one agrees that most of the things are true, even if one didn't put a camera and check out one's facial emotions. Yet, there are something that seems unnatural to oneself, particularly, some fast reactions. 

Say, when being prompt to think of causation between words, like _cottage, swiss, cake_, it says "cheese" is what link them together. For me, nothing comes to my mind. It seems that my mind can't make up immediate or even delayed causation between the words. 
One prompt two possibilities: one, one is different in brain working out words causation. Second, one just doesn't have good English knowledge. One can't pinpoint which is more greater a cause to the situation. 
Similarly, _dive, light, rocket_ have nothing that comes to my mind, they seems to have no causation at all. And given the answer _sky_ doesn't make any sense to me, at least not immediately. 
Perhaps, knowledge is scarce of the surrounding? 

Another difference one and what's mentioned in book comes to impression on these two sentence: 
- Alan: intelligent -- industrious -- impulsive -- critical -- stubborn -- envious
- Ben: envious -- stubborn -- critical -- impulsive -- industrious -- intelligent.
The book said, we would have better like for Alan as intelligent is our first impression of the person. For me, the first impression is, hey, Ben have the same characteristics as Alan, in reverse order! It is unknown why one think this way. 

Another is this: Given the first statement
- _Julie read fluently when she was four years old._

to influence subsequent questions: 
- _How tall is a man who is as tall as Julie was precocious?_

Nothing comes to one mind. One's brain gives blank when trying to relate a "progress bar" from Julie to a "progress bar" in height. It says, they're unrelated. 
One's brain could not fit one to the other. 
Other questions like: 
- _What level of income in your profession matches Julie's reading achievement?_
- _Which crime is as severe as Julie was precocious?_
- _Which graduating GPA in an Ivy League college matches Julie's reading?_

My first impressions are: 
- What does my profession have to do with Julie? None of her business. 
- (I forgot my reaction, but remember I focus on the word "crime" and disregard "Julie", so probably thinking of none of her business again.)
- (I don't follow Ivy League or know what a GPA is)

(Will be updated again if one found more as one haven't finish the book). 

## Conclusion
Generally, one agree with most of what the book content said, with some that may be matching for others but not what one react with.
