# Our Doctrine

Have you heard of the [Rails Doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine)? We have our own doctrine: things that we follow and perhaps "wish" to change the world of. This doctrine will update as we change; 
and hopefully we find our pillars as we go.

## Cooperate, not Compete
While most companies are "competitive" in nature, we strives for cooperation. Why compete when we can cooperate? Competition tries to kick everyone down the ladder they're climbing, so they're the only ones on the ladder, and on the top of everyone else's rung;
while cooperation tries to make the ladder a wide staircase (plus a platform at the top) so everyone could stand at the top together. 
When designing programs, we shall aim to design programs that promote cooperation, not competition. We shall not limit things to only the top few; but everyone to have fun. Perhaps we shall not promote a difference between people, at least on the baseline level, so everyone get rewarded the same. 

Will competition be eliminated? No, unfortunately. Mother nature have carved competition so deep in our veins that we can't eliminate it with longer evolutions. 
Though, we could do better. People could help each other. [Give and Take] by Adam Grant suggests giving to other people (for free) and those you give to naturally help pushes you up; instead of you stepping on others to get up. 

We promote teamwork, but we don't restraint (with rules) and force people to do something. 
People whom gives each other naturally attracts people to form a group, each giving their own idea so the whole idea makes better, than fighting for who is right and who is wrong then (wistfully) compromise. 
For [synergize] allows each other to understand each other's perspective, each other's worries and doubts, and each other's strength (from a different viewpoint), to form a better solution than any one of us could form without each other. 
For people willingly, and openly, cooperate. 

And get better together.
