# Afterthought: The Undoing Project By Michael Lewis
afterthought history

Actually, one don't understand what this book is about before one started to read it. The title didn't suggest anything; but reading the excerpt, or abstract, of the book from the internet, it suggests of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Now, one had read _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ last year or two, forgot when, during a Chinese New Year period; but one had forgotten most of the stuffs. After reading this book, one felt like going back to read that book, but that'll have to wait some time while one look to other books first. Can't burn in a single field until the grass can't grow back! 

It ended up interesting, talking about the stories of Danny (Daniel Kahneman) and Amos, their interactions, etc. Not to say they're exactly right, we'll talk about that in a while, but it is certainly enticing, and promoting the heuristics remind me of what one had forgotten long ago (well except for confirmation bias and hindsight bias, which one always use these two). In _Thinking, Fast and Slow_, Kahneman introduced quite a few heuristics that without a checklist, one can't remember them. Anchoring, yes, but only sometimes (one could remember in specific events). Availability bias, nope, not until it was re-introduced. 

#### Generally Speaking of Biography and History

But who gave us the permission to write about biography, of history? We're not them, so we could never understand how they think, why they behave, etc. You may ask, but even themselves they probably don't understand why; their unconscious may be the one making decisions without themselves knowing why in the conscious. Historians and biographers probably wrote histories and biographies that incorporates their own judgment (which isn't necessarily correct), plus their own stereotypes (which distorts). Plus we have preferences, opinions. Humans are imperfect; and imperfect human cannot write history and biography from a neutral point of view. One could present the case as an argument, but one should use a less convincing language, like "perhaps", "maybe", "probably", to demonstrate that the author isn't all-knowing. 

Then why do people write histories and biographies, if it can't be perfect? In fact, no books are perfect, even outside of histories and biographies. And waiting for perfection before publishing a book, the book probably never get published. A good enough representation is good enough for most of us to have an entertainment, and perhaps learn something, out of the book. Perfection isn't in one's concern. 

What about cross-checking with one another? It may or may not work. It may work if works are published independently, without reading each other's published work, so we could pick up the difference between their writings and make hypothesis to test which one is false, or at least false under what circumstances. If it's a single source written by multiple person, it might work as well, that each author are fighting each other to get the correct answer onto the book; but it could also be a compromise, where one put one's (flawful) thinking in this paragraph, in exchange for you putting yours (flawful) thinking in another paragraph, and we end up with more flawful thinking than if one of us had written it alone, or both of us written it alone, and published separately. 

Plus, the passing down of information is what really matters. Even if it is distorted. Even if it is not totally correct. What matters is we know something from our ancestors, we learn from it, even if it is just an entertainment. Fables existed, you know. 

#### Something Weird

There was one sentence's date one found weird. 

> Danny, being Danny, looked for the good in Gigerenzer's writings. He found this harder than usual to do. He'd avoided even visiting Germany until the **1970s**.

Ok, but at the start of the section, 

> In October **1993** Danny and Amos found themselves together at the same conference in Turin, Italy... There was a new critic of their work, a German psychologists named Gerd Gigerenzer, and he was getting a new kind of attention...

The date doesn't seem to match. Lazy to check the reference, one can't set up an argument whether this is: 
- a spurious correlation, hence not a causation of any sort but 2 independent events. 
- the date was wrongly typed???

#### Conclusion
One would recommend reading this book first before passing in Thinking, Fast and Slow, just so your inner hearts would align with the stories, and perhaps might give you better understanding of how difficult a heuristics is to come out of a scientists, rather than just "Law of the Small Numbers" that mean _something_ to you, but that something isn't strong enough for you to take effort remembering it. It's like, associating a story to what you read.
