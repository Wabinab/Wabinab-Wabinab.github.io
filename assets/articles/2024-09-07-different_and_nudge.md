# Different by Youngme Moon and Nudge by Thaler & Sunstein, An Afterthought
afterthought

Being different, standing out from the crowd, perhaps being unique (at least locally), is what makes everyone remembers rather than "you're just one of those..." or "you're just a shadow of..." or "you just don't have your identity." So much for standing out and have a name for ourselves rather than being called "strangers" or "one of the crowd" with no names.
