# Afterthought: Superforecasting by Philip Tetlock
afterthought

One actually started this book out of curiosity. Since the last Bitcoin crash in 2021, Bitcoin had been rising for the past year, albeit slowly. One uses gut feeling plus fear and greed index to make decisions, and that misses much opportunity. Seeing Bitcoin rise, one wanted to predict, when will the next crash be, so one could sold off one's assets before the crash? Let's rephrase: will Bitcoin lose more than a-third of its value in the next 3 months, starting now? 

Many make forecasts for different reasons. To be a superforecasters, you'd aim at accuracy. More accurately, "calibration" and "resolution". Calibration is how close your prediction is to the true value, while resolution is how daring are you at predicting at the extremes. You'd want to have good calibration, and being more daring. Of course, that's not always possible, even among existing superforecasters. 

You want to doubt yourself, and prepare to change your thinking when you fails. Those not are stubborn, being too attached to something that they treat it as their identity. How do you learn, if you don't change your thinking? 

If you think that your future generations, or past generations, are better than your generation, it's time to think again. "Regression to the mean" justifies that we always become more mundane, if we don't take effort to oppose it. People don't always look up to improve; sometimes, they look down to see if anyone's worse. If you're a mundane person, and you'd like to improve, try raise the "mean." 

Turning points are usually, but not necessarily, unpredictable. Something that happens abruptly, like COVID 19, is more unpredictable than something that escalates slowly (like more warring states in the recent years) (more predictable, one can't say if it'll increase or decrease, and if you "hope" that it decrease; well, can you make the difference?) 

Probably the most useful text in the book is "Fermi Approximation" and "Outside View". They provide good estimate of the percentage an event would or wouldn't happen. That means, if you have no time to take the "Inside View", even just 5 minutes considering Fermi Approximation, plus another 5-10 minutes, with minimal research, considering "Outside View", give you a reasonable view of an event. 

The "why" calms your soul, while the "how" brings you truth. 

Science brings us correlation between 2 events; we humans assume they're causation than correlation. Causation explains the "why", correlation is a temporary "how." (How do they relate? Are there evidence to disprove their correlation?) Though, causation is a good-enough filter to throw away irrelevant information that, if you're oversensitive, may sway your estimates. 

You have a goal, but you don't know how to achieve it. The latter requires you to figure it out. 

We know we can learn a lot from history, but we are also influenced by emotions. In wars, we commonly learn from those "good guys," what lessons can they teach? Do you know that the German army in World War II have something to teach you? Now you know. Does something negative rise inside you? Defensive? Vomiting? Refusal? Your emotions are controlling you, don't let them so. Don't let your emotions prevent you from learning something useful! 

In conclusion, this is a great book. The most important thing is it opens oneself to broader thinking, apart from _Think Again_ by Adam Grant. The concepts aren't new; you could find them in other books, but who would not like a compilation? Even those who wants deeper insight -- as they now know where to find the books they want deeper insights into. Plus, it allows one to question oneself, what assumptions do one make? 


### Notes:
1. Though, COVID 19 isn't entirely unpredictable; if we look back, it didn't happen that rapidly enough. It's just we've been too decadent since the last virus outbreak that we feel numb, assuming it'll be just another "quickly go away" virus. 
2. During this search, one actually come across [Farnam Street](fs.blog). Before this book, one had "run out of interesting book to read." Farnam Street actually introduces more book for me to read, and now my "library" is flooded with books (even after deciding what one want to read and what not). You'd want to take a look, if you don't already know.
