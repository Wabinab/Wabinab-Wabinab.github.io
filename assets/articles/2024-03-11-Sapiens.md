# Afterthought: Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari
afterthought

Author first introduced the Cognitive Revolution of _Homo Sapiens_ that allow it to wipe out many species, especially those giant animals/mammals, and other _Homo_ species. The Cognitive Revolution allows us to imagine fictional entities, individually or collectively, that opens the path to large scale cooperation. Example, everyone believing in the same god, and in modern days, everyone believing in "limited liability companies (**LLC**)" like Google, Apple, Tesla, (science???), etc. 

> It really strikes one, when the author said that lawyers are no different from shamans whom perform some magical enchantation that raise LLC to become alive. 

Before, one thought that since everyone lives in Pangea, access to other continents can be done on foot. Now, author introduced that they might have created ocean-going vessels! So, the Dutch weren't the first to introduce ocean-going vessels, but our ancient ancestors, who don't even know how to plant plants yet? What do they eat at sea (you can't forage on your boat, can you)? And how did their boats look like? Do they harness the power of winds? Too bad, we didn't find any fossils of boats (they may have decayed anyways, woods aren't long live)... 

Author next introduced the Agricultural Revolution. Basically, the foundation of plants that could be planted, like wheat, maize (corn), potatoes; and animals like cow, sheep, chicken, pigs. What's most mind opening was, despite it frees many to do other stuffs (like writing novels, engage in politicals, becoming an orator, etc.) it's **the plants that enslaves us, not us taming plants.** 

Most plants contain only a fraction of nutrients and proteins that the body needs (these are the stuffs that our body can't produce them, but we need them, so they must be intake). In fact, wheat don't contain everything, they're hard to digest, bad for teeth and gums (author said, one don't know about this). Plus, author argue that wheat don't offer economic security, plus they're weak, they required extra care from _Homo Sapiens_ to live. And, farmers work harder and longer hours than foragers and/or hunter gatherers. 

As for population explosion? You'd need more hands to care for the wheat, but more hands means more mouth, so production might exceed consumption on good days, but there's no production (yet still have consumption) on bad days. Such extra burdens enslave human beings. 

It's like today, where luxuries turn into necessities, into obligation. An example author give is the internet, email. Where in snail-mail era, it's such a burden to get a letter to someone that when you gather enough courage to do it, you would think a lot about what to put down, before putting down. Plus, it's a long way to and from, and you pay for it (well, you also pay for the internet, but that don't come into your mind because you don't usually associate it with emailing, but watching videos, because the latter is what consumes lots of bandwidth. While the latter, you pay for the stamp). 

One would like to give 2 examples:

First, the mobile phone. Probably first invented for military use, then later for business use like those of Ericsson (if one's not mistaken), then later for commercial and home use. We turned it from a device that facilitates our life, to enslaves our life. Can you live without a mobile phone today? You probably don't, except for the few. 

Second, given that we like to have some object enslaving us, so we don't have to worry about life and take any responsibility (we can have something to blame), there's a game one used to play, called "Last Fortress", that does just that. At some weeks into the game, if you'd join the top alliance in the world, they introduce something called "[Alliance Duel](https://last-fortress-underground.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance_Duel)" that lasted forever, every week, where Monday you have to send trucks to gather every 5-8 hours (depending on how efficient your truck gathering mechanism is, based on research), which means setting an alarm to remind yourself that the truck is back, and you'd want to send it off. 

Tuesday, collect buildings. This means you build these buildings to completion, but don't collect them yet, then collect them during the day. Wednesday, Research. That means collect enough speedups and diamonds and Z-coins and go splash, spend an hour just clicking speedups, waiting for handshakes, etc. Thursday, Recruit Heroes. This is easiest and least time consuming, could easily be done in 15 minutes. Friday, train soldiers. This is hard, because there's a limit on your soldiers, and it's hard to gather enough speedups to train them. Saturday, enemy invasion. This is very time consuming. It requires you to sit your whole saturday in front of the screen in case you got attacked by someone. In that case, a refreshing saturday reading books ([like this book](https://www.ynharari.com/fr/book/dapres-sapiens/)), going out with your family, etc. No more, you're now slave to the game. 

One day, one found out one's enslaved so badly that one need to quit. So one quit. Bravo! 

Back to the book, author said that, we probably need hands to build temples, that's why they can't forage or hunt anymore. Planting wheat yield more food, enough to feed those full-time working to build the temple (and perhaps the priest after the temple is built, if they have one). 

Plus, it's a catastrophe. If you understand animal torturing nowadays (on sheep, cow, chicken, and pigs), and how they slowly kill the animals by letting it bleed to death rather than "one slash KO no feel hurt baby" (that's why if you cook meat today, you found their blood aggregates a lot in their meat, because they encounter great stress before death that blood leaks into their muscles, which we call "meat"). Yes, they expand their numbers, but not their happiness. 

Plus before today, there's also human slaves, so human suffering is widespread. Plus, how do you know that nowadays human don't suffer more than their ancestors after the Agricultural Revolution? 

Remember that we said Gods and LLC are imagined? Well, let's expand on that. Countries are imagined. Our laws are imagined. Author introduced this "mindbreaking" concept, where laws first determined, and enforced, and accepted, therefore, we together bring something to life. Is there such thing as Humanity Rights? No, actually not. For humans are not born equal. The most basic different is we all have different facial features, different fingerprints, different DNA. And most viewable (but we refuse to view) difference are we born into different families (rich, poor, or poverty), with or without defects, taller or shorter (or in the extreme), of different colors, of different genders. So, we're not equal. But modern people can't admit that, for that's what we want to imagine, that's our anchor. That we **_wish_** to have everyone treated equally, or at least about equal. Ask someone millenials ago and they'd say slaves and commoners and superior people are the rankings required and imagined, and everyone believes in it. 

Next, humans have limited brain capabilities, especially when dealing with numbers. So, some invented partial scripts (that can only communicate specific information) like numbers and some signs (signifying what the numbers represent) to record it in clay, papyrus, bamboo sticks, etc. With full scripts, you can write novels with it; but usually, given the bulk heaviness of woods/clay/papyrus, it's still used for more important stuffs, like recording history. The only "novels" were of Gods and mythology, which they don't consider as novels, but voices of God. Then, the invention of catalogue sustains a larger empire, for if you store stuffs randomly, how're you going to find where things are? Plus, empires actually have local elites taking care of their business (decentralized government) and only report up what they have done without central intervention (unless it's so bad, or unless it's between 2 municipalities). This allow stuffs to be kept small, so no one have to know more than what's below their level of control, and the top only need to know about the elites who control peasants and slaves. 

What strikes one is the invention of computer binary language. Of course, we don't really write in binaries, not even assembly language, most of the time. People use higher level language like Python and C#, or mid-level language like C++ and Rust, that's more nearer to human language. Yet, nearer to human language isn't equal to human language. Because computer can't understand us, and because they can't learn (not until recent decade), we have to do the learning, and we have to understand them, and be their translator. That's why we build compilers and interpretors to translate our code into binaries for the computer to execute. 

In fact, the rise of artificial intelligence, one now see that one reasoning is to solve this "human learn computer language" stuffs. Ok, maybe not solve, one would be happy to learn a new language, even if it's not human language. Yet, for the majority who just can't twist their brain, typing something into a chatbox and have it generate the equivalent computer code for you (albeit, quite mundane code, sometimes stupid) means you don't need to learn the computer language to write decent code of small project. Just use your language. (Of course, you still need the ability to put your thoughts into words, and improve your writing and thinking skill). Take a look at [Clear Thinking](https://fs.blog/clear/) by Shane Parrish, and some books like [On Writing Well](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well) by William Zinsser, or [The Elements of Style](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33514.The_Elements_of_Style) by Strunk and White; they might help.

### Conclusion
Author really introduces stuff from viewpoints that one never encountered. It's worth reading, for it opens one's mind to something new, than from our usual viewpoints. 


### Notes: 
1. The trick is, it scores based on collect, so you can send your truck 5-8 hours before the event starts, and have it return just a few minutes into the event, so you'd have one extra point there. Since the event starts at 10.30 AM my local time, that means one would have to wake up early for it; one refuse to wake up at 4 AM or 5 AM-ish, so one wake at 7 AM; and that does change one's life a bit. Before, one wake up at 9 AM and slept late; now that one don't play the game anymore, it doesn't regress back and one still wake up around 7.30 AM. Great!
