# Afterthought: Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari
afterthought

The Cognitive Revolution of _Homo Sapiens_ opens a new world before us: the capability to imagine fictional entities. Myth, God, Limited Liability Companies (**LLC**) (Google, Apple, Tesla), Laws; they all exist in our imaginations. Common beliefs pave the road to large scale cooperations, like trading, or hunting down a giant mammal, among different tribes. 

> It really strikes one, when the author said that lawyers are no different from shamans whom perform some magical enchantation that raise LLC to life. 

How humans exit Africa and spread across continent is a mystery. The notion that someone long before the Dutch invented ocean-going vessels is impossible to imagine; like believing Atlantis acquiring technology ahead of us, or the Romans have piped water. It's more believable that they travel on foot, and that they still live in Pangea (the combination of the 7 continents in one single landmass), by common (non)sense. How to hunter gatherers hunt and gather fruits/vegetables on their boat? Did their boats resemble something of today, or just planks? Did they know how to use the winds? 

### Agricultural Revolution

Author next introduced the Agricultural Revolution. Basically, the foundation of plants that could be planted, like wheat, maize (corn), potatoes; and animals like cow, sheep, chicken, pigs could be tamed. The mind-boggling idea is that **plant enslaves us, not we tame plants.**

The pros of Agricultural Revolution we easily know, as we're the beneficial party. What about the cons? Author have lots of suggestions, and one'll list a few here. One, our body don't produce all necessary nutrients, and we intake them instead. Unfortunately, most single plant don't have all these nutrients we need, so our poor ancestors probably live with such malnourishment. Second, you work less time as a hunter gatherer than as a peasant; for wheat is like a baby that needs intensive care. Third, if drought, flood, pestilence hits, dependence on a single crop means much higher risk than dependence on tens of hundreds of different food source. Fourth, we thought it provides more food; but to plant more food, we need more hands at the field; and more hands means more mouth. Sure, it's undeniable that a very small percentage managed to escaped the field and go on to write our human history books. Fifth, natural disaster affecting a single crop means human have to think further into the future, to store food like squirrels. As a side effect, _homo sapiens_ now unlock "anxiety", as if you're not relying on a single crop, there's no need to worry about "no yield." 

As a sidenote, author compared the enslavement of _homo sapiens_ by crops, to us nowadays by emails. In the snail mail era, it's difficult to send a parcel to a far distance, neither is it cheap. You'd think twice whom you'd want to write to, and you'd think a lot what you'd want to put down, knowing that you won't receive their replies until months later. Today, the easiness of sending emails (and of course, text messages) via a click, and being instantaneous, for a very cheap price (even without subscribing for a plan, your internet cost per MB probably won't cost more than sending a physical letter), makes us send mindless letters and text. Read more in [3]. Luxuries turned into necessities, necessities turned into obligations. Someone would start to call you to remind you to reply to them if you haven't reply within minutes! Such stupidity. 

One would like to give 2 examples:

First, the mobile phone. Probably first invented for military use, then later for business use like those of Ericsson (if one's not mistaken), then later for commercial and home use. We turned it from a device that facilitates our life, to enslaves our life. Can you live without a mobile phone today? You probably don't, except for the few. 

Given these examples, one can't stop convincing oneself that human beings love being enslaved by external objects, as if they allow us to not take actions, as the object to be blamed and thrown responsibility to, when we're the ones which allow ourselves enslaved by them. 

Second example, a game called "Last Fortress." Few weeks into the game, they introduce [Alliance Duel](https://last-fortress-underground.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance_Duel)", which is an event that lasts until the end of the game (One never played till the end of the game, but someone mentioned there will be 4 or 5 seasons, with each season about 90 - 100 days, and the event starts about a month after the world is created [if my memory got it correct]), with a weekly cycle. 

- Monday, collect resources. You'd send your truck out to collect resources. Each truck dig for 5-8 hours before they're full and return. Points gained upon "collect", so you'd send your truck 5-8 hours (minus a few minutes, to ensure it come back AFTER the event starts) before the event starts, and it'll come back on time to boost your points. You'd set your alarm every 5-8 hours to disrupt whatever you're doing and turn your attention to resource gathering. Alternatively, you'd keep the screen on and check every few minutes or so, with great anxiety, to see if it's time or not. 
- Tuesday, collect buildings. You need to start building on Wednesday (one day after the event finish), but don't "collect" them after they're finished. Then, "collect" them on Tuesday. 
- Wednesday, research. Save your speedups for today. There's also a handshake protocol where alliance members could help you to speedup your research. You want to ask for the handshake first before using your speedup, because the former is based on percentage (up to a limit) of the current time left (not the initial time), while the latter is absolute no. of minutes. And alas, other people have their things to do, so they can't give you handshake immediately, and you'd have to wait. Usually one and a half hour wasted just like that. 
- Thursday, recruit heroes. This is least time consuming, taking around 15-30 minutes pressing "recruit" and "skip" button, plus some pauses with applause when you get "legendary heroes." 
- Friday, soldier training. Similar to research, etc; but harder. There's a limit of how many soldiers you can train, and the speedups aren't as effective as research speedups, because higher level soldiers train longer, and they don't scale linearly with the no. of speedups you can get. Therefore, to earn more points, people will wage war on weaklings, which consumes another one or two hours before you get enough points to not get kicked out of the top 1 alliance. (Top 1 alliance requires you to meet minimal points to not get kicked out, otherwise, how can they remain top 1?)
- Saturday, this is the worse. It requires you to spend your whole day on the screen, because it's war day. And like real war, you can only be prepared constantly for an invasion, and won't know when an invasion happens. Later in the game, most members might communicate to agree on a time where they'll start war; but given the difference in timezone and some people who don't receive the message, or just want to fight outside of the agreed time, you still have to keep an eye all day long. Your whole Saturday wasted and ruined. 

In conclusion, slave to the game. When one realized this so badly, one quit immediately. Ok, not immediately, but after procrastinating for 2 weeks, one can't hold it anymore, one quit. 

We can't really know what happens in the past. It's possible that hunter gatherers need time to build temples, and wheat frees them from collecting their own food. 

Agricultural Revolution isn't just about plants, but also of animals. Animals, despite reproducing more, live in desolation. Slaughtering of animals consists of cutting their neck and let them bleed to death; not anime katana "one slash KO no feel hurt baby." You could see how stress they feel by judging how much blood leaks into their muscles (what we call "meat"), which, if you notice in what you eat. 

### Imagined Entities
Remember that we said Gods and LLC are imagined? Well, let's expand on that. Countries are imagined. Our laws are imagined. Human Rights are imagined. We created something that everyone agrees about; nevertheless it's unreal. E.g. no humans are born equal. We have different facial features, different DNA, different fingerprints, different families (rich, poor, poverty), different ethnicity, different genders, different... But no, we wanted to be treated equal, so we imagined Human Rights, go through some process and gave it life. A few centuries ago, not everyone wanted to be treated equal, so there are slaves, commoners, and superior people. 

### Writing
Our brains aren't wired to store lots of information, especially numbers. The invention of partial scripts consisting of numbers and several symbols that link what the numbers represent allows recording on clay, papyrus, bamboo sticks, etc. Some tribes expand partial scripts to full scripts, allowing them to record history, write mythology and gods and novels, etc. Some tribes managed to invent catalogue, to group information together for easy retrieval; while those that not can't expand further. 

With a decentralized government, where local elites rule their municipalities, and only report to the king of the Empire, it frees the king from being a busybody, and free information from travelling long distance before a solution is decided. This allow for large empires without being overwhelmed by how many papyrus a central entity stores. Kings really only rule the local elites. 

We don't speak the same language as the computers. And since computer can't learn our language, at least not until recently, we have to learn computer language, to code in a language paired with a translator that convert it into what the computer can understand. The advent of AI do allow noobies to write some programming code, by asking AI to write for them, in human language; albeit, code produced by AI is quite mundane and can't sustain a large project per se without someone understanding computer code to organize it, modules by modules. 

Nevertheless, one'd like to emphasis the important of writing. No one could skip writing, for any reason, for writing facilitates thinking, and if you can't write clearly, AI can't understand what the heck you're trying to say, they can't execute what you want. Some books that might help are:

### Inequality
Inequality is an invented hierarchy that allows one to know how to treat strangers. For if everyone have equal hierarchy, who should listen to who? If you have a fight with a friend, you guys could sit down over a cup of coffee/tea and talk it over. In a smaller group, you can sit together and debate, with each having their turns to speak. Not so with thousands and millions and billions of people. The top-down hierarchy was then invented so there are the ruling superior class that sets the rule, and if the rule is acceptable, or at least forced to accept (via military forces), we'd achieve a semi-stable society, stable enough for it to exist for decades or centuries, before a revolution fire up and the cycle repeats itself. 

One thing one found interesting is the difference in the definition of masculinity. Look at the two pictures below. The former is King Louis XIV of France, the definition of masculinity in 18th century. That's long wig, stockings, high-heeled shoes, dancers posture -- and huge sword. The latter is Barack Obama, looking, in author's word, "dull and dreary" whereas masculinity in the past "have been colorful and flamboyant."

### Conclusion
Author introducing the same item from a different viewpoint, is worth reading to open our minds. 


### Notes: 
1. One isn't sure about Atlantis; so far, it seems like a myth. 
2. Romans have piped water, that's right! It's called "aqueduct." 
3. Most of us nowadays only write without edit. To turn back and re-read your work is more burdensome than clicking "send", which isn't the case for snail mail. Furthermore, the easiness of sending message has developed a ugly habit amongst users, where people no longer write in paragraphs, and worse, not even sentences. The "send button" had enslaved their minds to constantly click it after typing a few words. Another ugly, self-centered habit is to interrupt people in the middle. Example, one need some time to think about what one write, and explain it in a way that's understandable. However, people just keep sending me messages. One usually dealt with it by not reading anything sent between two message blocks (usually one block is image, another block of text, because they can't be send together, or there's limitations on the caption that one need to type longer messages so have to separate them), plus a restrain on oneself to not feel the Fear of Missing Out, so what they say without thinking isn't important. 
4. Since the event starts at 10.30 AM my local time, that means one would have to wake up early for it; one refuse to wake up at 4 AM or 5 AM-ish, so one wake at 7 AM; and that does change one's life a bit. Before, one wake up at 9 AM and slept late; now that one don't play the game anymore, it doesn't regress back and one still wake up around 7.30 AM. Great!
