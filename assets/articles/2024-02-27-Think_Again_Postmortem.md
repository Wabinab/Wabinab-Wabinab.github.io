# Postmortem: Think Again By Adam Grant
postmortem

Ok, we updated to a new website today, so let's write something. 

Previously, one had read a lot of books, but have never thought of making summarization until a few months back. After clearing some work, one finally had the time to work on a project called `Triangulation` (still private as of writing, you'd see it in the future), which attempts as a tool to put whatever being learnt into use. There are lots of learnings from various books, some support one another, others discriminate one another, and with that tool, one could put stuffs into actions. 

While that tool is under development, we would write postmortems. Originally, postmortems are intended when an incident happens, a detailed report of what causes it, etc. To prevent pointing fingers, for example. 

> In our case, postmortems are more like summary, included some personal thoughts, or thoughts taken from other writers, mesh together. **It's goals is to activate thinking.** 

Let's start. 

---

All living organisms integrates the flight-or-fight system vital for survival. Yet, the system isn't perfect: it's meant to dealt with physical threat, but also responds to verbal threat. Without your "human" brain, one'd reply an angry verbal signal with angry response. Similarly when we're proven wrong. Author split this into 3 interconnected modes, called _preacher_, _prosecutor_, and _politician_. 

We preach when our (sacred) belief are challenged (in simple words, when we lose face). To defend our (sacred) belief, we try to look for flaws in others' reasonings. In the extreme, we'd create flaws from thin air. (Believe me, gravity floats upwards, Newton is wrong, that's why the bird can floats. We humans aren't affected by gravity, so we sticks to the ground.) Then, we politick by conveying our ideas to an audience, to find approval confirming our beliefs. 

Then, author argue we should instead have **scientific thinking**. Instead of HODL-ing our ideas, we treat it as true-now-but-subject-to-change. We hold on not to answers and solutions, but questions and puzzles. Hence, the rethinking cycle consists of intellectual humility, doubt, curiosity, and discovery. To always be a beginner, to question how do we know what we know is correct, to find out what we don't know, and eureka (or, "that's funny")! We just need to open our mind. 

Ever heard of Big Data? How much of that do you think you can fit into your brain? If you can't fit everything into your brain, how can you be sure you really know what you know, and not merely an illusion? Many people have either the armchair quarterback syndrome (more confident than competent), or imposter syndrome (more competent than confident), when we need something in between. How do most reply when one don't know? One'd make up stuffs to fill in the gap, because the lose of face saying "I don't know" is so much more streneous than creating a lie and feel pride that one can improvise a lie. 

Unless you're an absolute beginner: and unless, you treat yourself "always a beginner." A beginner, when entering a new field, wants to learn more. They believe that they can learn, otherwise, they wouldn't be there in the first place. They also believe they know nothing about it, and it's okay to tell people, "I don't know! Why don't you teach me?" Not to say beginner don't feel the threat, especially when feedback is crude or harsh, but the curiosity to learn more increases one's tolerance to threat. **_How much worse can it get?_**

We would like to know **why**. 
- Why did you do this? 
- Why did you put it here? 
- Why are we in this situation? 

Starting with why, we tend to attach our emotions, especially when the "why" becomes our internal beliefs. Author suggests starting with **how**. 
- How did we end up here? 
- How come you put it here? 
- How did we end up in this situation?

Ok, not good enough. We're disguising "why" questions as "how". Instead, our "how" should focus on problem solving, not on the steps (or the reasons, if you're still asking why) we get ourselves where we are. 
- How can we solve this problem? 
- How can we move this to where we want it to be? 
- How can we get out of this situation? 

Much better. Author called this **task conflict**, compared to **relationship conflict**, where we argue on how to get things done, rather than how to solve our emotions; a debate over the task, than a disagreement between our beliefs. 

Ultimately, we can reach an agreement to solve on the task level, not on relationship level; but the other side don't necessarily want that. They may enforce to deal on an emotional level. The only person we can change, is ourself. If we can't change their mind, change ours. Even if they're preaching, prosecuting, politicking, there's something to learn that challenge our thoughts, after discarding whatever that fact-checked false, and retain those that experimentally-tested unable-to-falsify concepts. One could ask, "what evidence would change your mind?" If they agree, we could learn from one another, and see if we can help meet their conditions that starts their rethinking. If they say, "nothing can change my mind", sure, you can still change your mind without changing theirs. 

How do we know our thoughts is ours? How can we be sure, we aren't influenced as a child, from our parents? Example, if one's parent's are racist, and consider their conversation normal, we'd become learned racist without us knowing. These racist still exist around the world, even with many fighting for changes, it don't necessarily change everyone's minds. Maybe when you'd see someone of opposite skin color, you had a deep disgust inside. You'd fare better if you live in a multi-cultural city, but not when everyone around you is of one type, and everyone sees it normal to discriminate another type. If you'd read Chinese Novels (of a specific genre that one read, like 都市), it's understandable that they have a stronger negativity to America (of course, the names aren't exact, because it's fiction, so they'd change names; and because most writers can't think of a new world order except for "many countries" and "one single world government" in such genre, their "many countries" preserve our existing countries now) because China and America are very strong countries fighting economically for markets, and try to dominate the world in several sectors. There may be military war in the future, we don't know. Ok, that's not the point, it's **not understandable** why they still have negativity to Japan!!!? Understandably, World War II was such long time ago, that till now, the hatred hadn't been away? A lot of text goes like "oh, they'd attack us, and we'd crush them, so the island will sink beneath the sea forever", or "our neighbor come to our country to show their pride, and this is how we kick them out of our country." Where? Can you prove where still that exist? That army government had already been disbanded 80 years ago, only seen in history book, what's the point of hating? That just shows an unwillingness to change one's mind... And being swayed around by propaganda... Or unwilling to get disapproval from our parents, so we retain their racism/whatever-ism...

Since others aren't our puppet, we can't control them; and we mentioned we can only change our ideas. Yet, if others are open, we could change them without controlling them, by motivating them to change themselves. Persuasion and advice rarely works, as we incorporate not only our thinking, but also our will of control within, _unless you **ask for permission** to change their mind_. Rather, by listening to their ideas, and support them with "how can you execute that" questions, we prompt them to not stop at ideas sharing, but take it to actions. It's also possible that listening might change our mind; they might see things we don't see. 

Humans default to confirmation. "I must know whether this is true, or false." It requires constant attention to stay alert, i.e. to live with "maybe"; and humans can't exert attention for very long. If a 50%-maybe is so hard, what says the different shades of maybe (10% maybe, 72%-maybe). Yet, the world is complicated, complex; we can't deny that. In fact, what we believe as 0% or 100% may be 3% and 95%, or whatever number that's near 0 and 100, but never equals to. If we resort to "yes" or "no", we'd treat it as conclusion, and close off the topic, tick off the checkbox on to-think list, and clear it from our memory. Keeping things complicated with maybe requires attention at the back of our head, to consider it at intervals whether it's time to change our mind to either poles. 

### Conclusion
Of course, there is more in the book that you'd want to read yourself. We summarized some of the points above, and take some ideas from other books, like _Superforecasting_ by Philip Tetlock. Overall, one don't think this postmortem reaches what one wants, but since this is the first time one did it, one'll leave this "first draft" up. We'd improve in the future. 
[Post any suggestions here](https://github.com/Wabinab/Wabinab.github.io/discussions/2), one'll read it and consider the changes. 


### Notes: 
1. HODL: Hold On for Dear Life. Used in Crypto. 
2. Stereotypes only hold for quite a lot of people, and quite a lot may not even be "most", as it can be quite a lot and less than 50%. We can say there are a lot of people still being racist/whatever-ism, with many occurrences, but it doesn't incorporate most, and certainly not all.
