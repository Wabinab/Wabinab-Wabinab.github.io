# A Conversation

> They're... He's too logical. Every conversation, the aim was to resolve them; and the way of resolve is via pushing _his_ agenda forward. When someone starts a statement that clearly wants you to listen, but because you're not emotional enough to catch what they want, and instead forward _your_ agenda, that guy's gonna fed up. 

OK, so... so what is this 'agenda' you're speaking about? Don't everybody tries to forward their agenda in every single speech? I never heard of anyone don't have an agenda. 

> Well, there are people who _have_ an agenda, but they don't _push_ it forward to the one sharing. That agenda arises is inevitable, but whether it comes out of our mouth or not is controllable. As for 'agenda', one meant you're trying to push your thoughts to the other person. 

For example? 

> For example, say you want me to change. You'd say, "You speak too much." Or you can say, "You speak too much. You should shut up your mouth and let the other person speaks." The former does not have an agenda, but the latter has. 

How so? One don't understand. Isn't both trying to change _you_? 

> Yes, they are, but the former don't fit into one's definition of agenda, while the latter does. When you say, "You speak too much," you're speaking a _fact_ that's true or false, and you leave one to decide how's one going to deal with that. One could speak less, one could speak a lot less, or maybe, one could shut up for the moment before speaking again, or shut up altogether, exactra exactra. But if you say, "You speak too much. You should shut up your mouth and let the _other person_ speaks." All you're saying is, "Hey, I don't care what your thoughts are. I am the central of the universe. You should shut up and let _me_ do the speaking. Don't even care about replying, because I don't care about you, I don't care how you feel. All that's important is _me_." But to directly says "me" is too aggressive, so instead, you'd replace it with "the other person", just to give face; but that's on the surface. Underlying, you have an agenda -- you are to speak. You want to speak. And you think you _should_ speak instead of one. So, you give a suggestion, and that suggestion is your opinion on **how the problem should be solved.** 

OK, so you mean, if I don't have an agenda, I'll only raise the matter in mind. But if I have an agenda, I'll not only raise my thoughts about you, I'll also suggests to you what's the solution will be? 

> Exactly. 

OK... Is there an exception to that? 

> There are, you bet. Life is complicated, anyways; and there are no hard and fast rules to literally _everything_. This only applies to listening to a person whom had something to speak on their mind. If you're in a scientific debate, you bet the rules for conversing are more of clashing agendas. Or rather, the clash of truth, whether what one said is true or false. 

Right, I see. So, back to the agenda, one should not push to correct even if one is right and you're wrong? 

> OK, there are two questions you'd just ask that one want to clarify. First, whether one should push forward with suggestions even if one is true. For example, in a conversation one dropped in, someone said that "Don't learn those that has no use." and the reply is, "Well, _you see_, if you hadn't learned broadly, how do you know you like it? How do you know whether it's useful or not?" From a 3rd person standpoint, the conversation had nothing; truly logical. But if one's the person speaking "Don't learn those that has no use," one'd be fed up. **You** are not listening to me, instead proposing a debate that push forward **your** agenda, **your** thoughts. **You** do not care about _me_. **You** do not even bother listening, immediately treated one's statement as false _logically_, and **dismissed one's emotions!** True or false, emotions are really the important part in the conversation. 
>
> The second part is your misunderstanding of right and wrong, versus true and false. They're not the same. 

Oh? What's the differences? 

> True or false addresses the _fact_. Like it or not, something's being true is true, you cannot change it. Right or wrong addresses the _moral_, and moral is based on a lot of stuffs, including our own taste, opinions, our cultural influence, exactra exactra. Let me give you an example. 

Um hmm...

> In the far past, before agricultural revolution, when an old human dies, he/she expects his tribe to eat his flesh. 

Yuck!!!

> That's a fact that we cannot change. It's "true". However, cannibalism is politically wrong in our modern culture, so when one speak of it, you felt disgusted. So, you'd say that it's "wrong". 

OK, one got it. A history of something that'd happened isn't changeable, so that's a fact. But how we think of it is changeable, so it's a moral, an opinion. 

> Yes. The people in the past think it's morally "right" to eat your elders, because if you don't, it's a waste of food. Food was scarce back then. 

Right, I see.
