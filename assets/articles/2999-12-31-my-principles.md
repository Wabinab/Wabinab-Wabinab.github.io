# My Principles

## Life Principles
1. Never reject a non-damaging friendship from my side, only from the other person's side. One should not let one's self-talk oneself out of a relationship; rather, only when the other person configures to quit, shall we talk it over. Narcissistic and blood-sucking relationship excluded. 
2. Only speaks of emotions in conversation, aka speaking to another person; excluding texting, emailing. Best real-life meetups, followed by video calls, and preferably not voice calls. Texting ruins relationship. 
3. Do not look at phone/web even when it has an awkward pause. Instead, use the awkward pause as a motivation to squeeze more content from your brain, trying to come up with something original that could entertain the other person, be it a question for one's friend, or a statement/story to share with. 
4. Always give several days to think through a problem. One's hotheadedness tend to make wrong decisions, and there almost is a better solution that comes later in the days, especially consider what we "need" vs "want". 
5. When a problem arise, always face it asap; aside from the extra time to calm ourselves down to a relative level (so we don't blame other people but resort to problem solving), solving a problem frees your mind of that problem, gives doses of serotonin/dopamine/etc, and trust each other that in the future problem arise, we'll be able to solve it. 
6. Never turn away from a problems, persevere through despite the challenges that comes with it, even if we can't solve the problems. 

## Other Principles
1. When encounter a problem and learn something about it, aside from writing down in the principles, also write them down as a blog post for everyone to know more about it. The blog post doesn't have to be long; but more of an informational read. 
2. As per Adam Grant's _Originals_, trust most whatever said when it involves the person's majors, but not as much on what the person not majors in. E.g. Steve Jobs wrongly predicted the Segway, but his predictions in tech and Apple futures are excellent. 
3. Always hold a center position to triangulate between multiple people of different positions, to ensure one isn't intrigued and trapped by _selection bias_ and other biases. 
4. Do not lower one standard to meet the society's standard. Just because many didn't have job doesn't mean one can not have job. Just because many didn't make new friends doesn't mean one can not make new friends. 
5. As per Adam Grant's _Hidden Potential_, always face the difficulty with courage. Courage to embrace the discomfort, courage to use one's knowledge as one acquires it (and not wait until one masters it), and courage to make more mistakes!
