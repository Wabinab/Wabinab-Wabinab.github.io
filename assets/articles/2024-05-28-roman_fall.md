# Afterthought: The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire By Edward Gibbon
afterthought history

Ok, it was far from an afterthought, for one only finished 11 chapters out of 71, but one already had some thoughts about it, so let's start writing, and we'll add the extra later.

There was two main flaws one like to discuss today; but before that, let one clarify how one intend to read the book. As a history book, one tend to read it like how one would read a novel rather than going for an exam, hence, _relaxing_ style. To enjoy the world history than to burden oneself with the dates and place and time and politics and whatsoever. The previous history book, The Renaissance by Will and Ariel Durant, had done a great job on that. Unfortunately, this book doesn't. 

First, it had **_BAD_** English, and by bad, one mean real _bad_. What defines a good English? **Simple and clear** (non-native speakers that had English education until high school, or even university level, should not have difficulty understand the flow of the story). So, let's assess the story. 

**Is it simple?** Unfortunately not. The use, or one would rather say, _abuse_, of difficult-to-understand vocabulary exponentially increase the difficulty reading the story. Not to say it can't be read, but it now requires a non-relaxing stance, instead a studying stance, to focus lots of attention in order to understand how the story actually flows. If you ignore the vocabulary, the whole story plot still could be understandable without searching the dictionary, but it would be much more difficult than a relaxing read. 

Furthermore, you _need_ to search the dictionary, with definition of words filling up the margins. Unfortunately, we can't learn so much words at the same time, so when we encountered it again in the future, we most likely forget about it, and have to either search back, or in the case where the number of words that one don't understand exceeds 50 in a day, one even forgot one searched about the word before. It shouldn't be like this. It's _compulsory_ to have difficult words in your books, because you want the reader to engage with you and learn something new. [1] But there is a limit to how much fancy vocabulary one should use in a given amount of wordings; abusing it is equals to the "terms and conditions" you read online when they ask you to accept it before you can use some app or visit some website, oh, the unlimited scroll and stupidity of its design. 

Let's move on, **is it clear?** Unfortunately not. It's okay to use long sentences especially when you add description to something, like describing the nose and the mouth of a face, then continued on to describe how one feels about that person, and continue to describe about how that person behaves (does he/she speaks loud/soft? or maybe easily infuriated?), etc. Even the previous sentence is a long one, with lots of commas. The problem is when you abuse unnecessary wordings in a sentence. Some sentences could be rephrased such that they could be easily understand, without all those commas twisting here and there. One isn't sure if this was how English was spoken in late 18th century (when the book was published), or is there a simpler way to converse English to the public. 

What's the problem with unclear sentences? One had to confess, one remember almost nothing from the book so far, except someone ran to some Praetorian camp to avoid being assassinated, and that's basically it! Oh, the futility! How could one make sentences so difficult to understand and so difficult to remember? Books like "The Structure of Everyday Life" that one is currently reading, and "The Renaissance" by Will and Ariel Durant wasn't completely clear of bad English, and they do have difficult languages, but overall, they are easy to understand and easy to remember, reading casually. This? Not at all! 

It was so bad that one had to write this afterthought before one ended it. The last time one wrote an afterthought before one ended the book, is because one had too much to say about the book (Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, and Antifragile by Nassim Taleb) that one was afraid one don't remember what one want to say if one started after. This is the first afterthought one wrote early to confess its bad English. 

Anyway, will make an update again after one finished Volume 1 (presumably, Chapter 1-16 inclusive). 


### Notes:
1. Books that totally use easy-to-understand language, despite easy, makes our brain lazy, and when our brain don't move, we don't remember what is mentioned.
